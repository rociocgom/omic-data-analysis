# omic-data-analysis

This repository contains four main folders, each corresponding to a distinct project of my Master's in Omic Data Analysis. 

- **Prefoldin-ChIP-seq-analysis/**  
  Contains all materials related to my Masterâ€™s thesis, including analysis scripts and resources.

- **ChIP-seq-analysis/**  
  Contains a R Markdown file related to ChIP-seq data analysis from a group project.  
  *Note:* This folder may not include all raw data files, images, or tables; it is intended to showcase the general workflow and interpretation.

- **RNA-seq-analysis/**  
  Contains a R Markdown file for RNA-seq analysis performed in a group project.  
  *Note:* Some supplementary files like images or tables might be omitted. This folder primarily demonstrates the analysis pipeline and results overview.

- **Multi-omic-analysis/**  
  Contains integration analyses combining data from multiple omics ((RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq and metabolomics) from a group project.  
  *Note:* Additional data files such as figures or tables may be missing. The focus is on workflow presentation and interpretation.

# Notes 

- Except for the **Prefoldin-ChIP-seq-analysis/** folder, all other folders contain code from collaborative group projects.  
- Due to accessibility limitations, some supplementary data (e.g., images, raw tables) are not included here.  
- The provided R Markdown files are fully functional and illustrate the main steps, code, and interpretations used during the analyses.
